      I am a data scientist and engineer with several years of experience
      working in the energy and urban mobility industries. My core technical
      competencies include, but are not limited to, data analytics / dashboards,
      data warehousing, predictive modeling, time series forecasting, and
      optimization.


      ###### 

      I am currently a co-founder at TouchLight Innovations where I have
      developed machine learning and optimization algorithms to intelligently
      manage energy consumption to incorporate renewable energy. I developed the
      end-to-end platform from API integration, data warehousing, and predictive
      modeling.


      ###### 

      Previously, I was a data scientist at Gogoro Energy Network, where I
      developed energy algorithms to support R&D of next generation Li-ion
      battery packs and operations of the battery swapping network that
      supported over 300,000 electric scooter users. The core energy software
      managed over 500 MWh of energy.
