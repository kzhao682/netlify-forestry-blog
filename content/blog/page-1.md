The start of the new decade has been simultaneously marked with alarming signals in climate trends as well as a promising outlook for a new era of renewable energy. 
###### 
In California, forest fires burning a total of 4.2 million acres is the most in a single year ever recorded and surpassed the total acreage burned in the last three years combined. The Atlantic hurricane season in 2020 was one of the most destructive in history with 30 storms, many of which were Category 3, 4, and 5, affecting the area. These climate-influenced disasters on top of a global pandemic unlike one we have ever seen have put much of the world in shock. 
###### 
Despite these untimely series of catostrophic events, there has been signs of promise in a lower carbon future. Renewable energy and energy storage technology continue to improve and are becoming more affordable globally. Government policies and new technology are also innovating new ways to accelerate adoption of clean energy on a larger scale. The recent rise of clean energy stocks mark a sign of confidence that renewable energy will take over fossil fuels as the new standard.

### EV becoming the new norm of automobiles

- Tesla and NIO stocks have increase X% over the past year
- new materials are enabling better EV with better performance, safety, and larger range
- ML/AI driving R&D of self-driving cars that could change the landscape of mobility
- trend will continue with EV becoming the only automobiles that are sold

### Micromobility makes impact in urban areas

- urban technology also benefited from improvements in energy storage and ML/AI technologies
- microbility a different implementation of new improved technologies
- Bird and Lime in many cities in the US and Europe
- In Asia, companies like Gogoro have developed battery swapping network that have deployed 1900 stations all around Taiwan
- Has potential to solve a critical problem of providing cleaner and accessible transportation to millions of peopl worldwide.

### Value of battery technology

- electrochemical storage, like battery and fuel cells, untaps the potential of renewable energy for not only transportation but also stationary usage
- scientific research has found different chemical compounds to not only improve Li-ion batteries but also explore different materials alternatives
- Much of the challenges with wide adoption of battery technology today
- Government subsidies would help drive cost lower and new presidential election signals more resources for the clean energy sector
- Development and commercialization of batteries with new chemistries is a slow process
- Defects and inconsistency in production and aggressive usage affect the finances of companies looking to bring the products to market
- ML and AI algorithms have better optimized the conditions of usage and significantly lowered the costs of the operations and research
- ML/AI and new materials breakthrough have the potential to help renewable energy reach critical mass and bring widespread adoption all across the world
