The start of the new decade has been simultaneously marked with alarming signals in climate trends as well as a promising outlook for a new era of renewable energy. 
###### 
In California, forest fires burning a total of 4.2 million acres is the most in a single year ever recorded and surpassed the total acreage burned in the last three years combined. The Atlantic hurricane season in 2020 was one of the most destructive in history with 30 storms, many of which were Category 3, 4, and 5, affecting the area. These climate-influenced disasters on top of a global pandemic unlike one we have ever seen have put much of the world in shock. 
###### 
Despite these untimely series of catostrophic events, there has been signs of promise in a lower carbon future. Renewable energy and energy storage technology continue to improve and are becoming more affordable globally. Government policies and new technology are also innovating new ways to accelerate adoption of clean energy on a larger scale. The recent rise of clean energy stocks mark a sign of confidence that renewable energy will soon take over fossil fuels as the new standard.
