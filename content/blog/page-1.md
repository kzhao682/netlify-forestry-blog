The start of the new decade has been simultaneously marked with alarming signals in climate trends as well as a promising outlook for a new era of renewable energy. 
###### 
In California, forest fires burning a total of 4.2 million acres is the most in a single year ever recorded and surpassed the total acreage burned in the last three years combined. The Atlantic hurricane season in 2020 was one of the most destructive in history with 30 storms, many of which were Category 3, 4, and 5, affecting the area. These climate-influenced disasters on top of a global pandemic unlike one we have ever seen have put much of the world in shock. 
###### 
Despite these untimely series of catostrophic events, there has been signs of promise in a lower carbon future. Renewable energy and energy storage technology continue to improve and are becoming more affordable globally. Government policies and new technology are also innovating new ways to accelerate adoption of clean energy on a larger scale. The recent rise of clean energy stocks mark a sign of confidence that renewable energy will take over fossil fuels as the new standard.

### EV becoming the new norm of automobiles

Over the past year, Tesla and NIO stocks have risen over 800% and 2000% and are accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. Improved battery technology is enabling EV companies to produce automobiles with better performance, safety, and range.
###### 
New features like self-driving capabilities enabled by machine learning and AI could drastically change the landscape of how people get from point A to point B. Continued development of AI algorithms and better computing power from 5G will continue to push to make driverless cars a reality.

###### 
As more governments are pushing legistlation to ban the sales of gasoline vehicles, EV will start to shape out as the new norm of automobiles. 

### Micromobility makes impact in urban areas

The UN estimated in 2016 that 54% of the world population now live in urban areas, which typically produce the most carbon emissions. Better urban technology has the potential to reduce carbon emission via clean transportation and devise more efficient methods to get from point A to point B. The challenge is in the millions of people who live in the urban areas - traffic does not make EVs the most viable method for most people.

###### 
The micromobility sector implements the same energy storage and ML/AI technologies in a different way that better serves densely populated areas. Electric scooter sharing companies, like Bird and Lime, have expanded their service in many cities across the US and Europe. In Asia, companies like Gogoro have developed a battery swapping network for electric scooter users and have deployed over 1000 stations all around Taiwan.

###### 
The flow of investments in urban mobility startups show the confidence in smaller sized transportation mediums to become an integral part of cities. They have the potential to solve a critical problem of providing cleaner and more accessible transportation to millions of people worldwide.

### Value of battery technology

Electrochemical energy storage, like battery and fuel cells, are important for unlocking the full potential of renewable energy to be used for not only transportation but also stationary purposes. Over the past decades, scientific research has found new chemical compounds to not only improve Li-ion batteries but also explore different materials alternatives. Quantumscape and Sila Nanotechnologies are both addressing different issues with Li-ion batteries by improving the safety, longevity, and energy density. Natron Energy and EnerVenue are working on commercializing Na-ion and metal-hydride batteries as cheaper and more abundant alternatives to lithium.
###### 
Much of the challenges with wide adoption of battery technology today is the high costs of production. Government subsidies will help drive costs lower and the US transition to a Biden presidency signals more resources for the clean energy sector. However, commercialization of new battery chemistries is a lengthy process that takes years of R&D and testing before implementation. Defects in production and usage in harsh environments directly affect one of the most expensive components and assets of EV companies. Addressing these problems are therefore critical to the progress of cleaner transportation.

###### 
In recent years, ML and AI algorithms have better optimized the conditions of battery usage and signifcantly reduced the costs of operations and research. We believe that the intersection of energy storage and ML/AI will be an important part of realizing a world that has progressed from fossil fuels to renewable resources.
